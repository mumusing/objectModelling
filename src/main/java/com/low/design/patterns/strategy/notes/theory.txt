Strategy Design Pattern:
1) Use different variants of an algorithum within an object and be able to switch from one algorithum
   to another during runtime

2) Strategy pattern is also known as Policy Pattern

3) Strategy pattern is behavioural pattern

4) Use to change behaviour at the run time

Strategy Pattern: Declares a method the context uses to execute a strategy

Context: The context maintains a reference to one of the concrete strategies

Concrete Strategy: Concrete Strategies implement different variations of an algorithm the context uses
