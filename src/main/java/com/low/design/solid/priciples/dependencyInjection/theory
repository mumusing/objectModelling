Dependency Inversion  Principle:
 1) High level modules should not depend upon low-level modules; they should depend on abstractions
 2) Separate implementations from abstractions
 3) Makes mandatory approach to code to abstractions/interfaces
 4) Let's us forget about who will construct/instantiate the dependency
 5) Improves code maintaining and helps unit testing much simpler to do
