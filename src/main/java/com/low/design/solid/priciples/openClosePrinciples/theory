Open / Close Principles:

-> Code should be open for Extension but should be closed for Modification.

-> Rules to be careful about when applying OCP
     -> Try to avoid Inheritance as it introduce tight coupling - if the superclass changes,
        subclasses may need to be modified, too.

-> Use Abstraction ( interfaces ) to enable you to adapt the functionality of your application
   without changing the existing code.

-> Software entities(classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for
   modification.
